Example

This example demonstrates how to use the RTC library methods. This
function describes how to use the RTC API. The RTC function is
implemented by an independent BCD timer/counter.

Select the correct Ameba development board from the Arduino IDE: “Tools”
-> “Board”. Then open the “RTC” example from:”File” -> “Examples” ->
“AmebaRTC” -> “Simple_RTC “:

Upon successfully upload the sample code and press the reset button,
