Which DDR is used by AME82-mini? DDR2 or DDR3?
==============================================

We set up the internal memory with DDR2 (1.8 V), but after checking the datasheet, we are unsure if this is the right configuration or the difference with the DDR3L (1.35 V).

**Answer**

The modules available for sale are DDR2 version, the default voltage should be set to DDR2 1.8V. In addition, R71 should set to 75K (DDR2, 1.8 V).
