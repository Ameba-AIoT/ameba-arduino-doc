How can I control debug logs?
=============================

**Answer**

Yes, you can. There are options available to enable or disable both the selected system logs and the Arduino API logs.

Please refer to `AMB82 Mini Getting Started - Selection Ameba Modes <https://ameba-doc-arduino-sdk.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/ameba_pro2/amb82-mini/Getting_Started/Getting%20Started%20with%20Ameba.html#step-1-selection-ameba-modes>`_
