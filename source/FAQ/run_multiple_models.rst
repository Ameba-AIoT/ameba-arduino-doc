Can I deploy multiple models on AMB82 Mini?
===========================================

**Answer**

Yes, thatâ€™s possible.

Due to memory limitations when loading models to flash, we suggest using the `SD card method <https://ameba-doc-arduino-sdk.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/ameba_pro2/amb82-mini/Other_Guides/AI_Related_Guides/Customized%20AI%20Model%20Installation%20Guide.html#load-neural-network-models-via-sd-card>`_ when deploying multiple models.
