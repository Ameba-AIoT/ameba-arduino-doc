Is there a source for JXF-37 sensor replacement?
================================================

**Answer**

Unfortunately, there is no source for replacement as the manufacturer for JXF-37 does not sell them individually. If possible, you may want to try with another sensor model instead, please refer to the list of supported sensors in `FreeRTOS SDK <https://github.com/Ameba-AIoT/ameba-rtos-pro2/blob/main/project/realtek_amebapro2_v0_example/inc/sensor.h>`_.

When choosing your sensor, please note that AMB82 Mini is only compatible with MIPI type sensors.
