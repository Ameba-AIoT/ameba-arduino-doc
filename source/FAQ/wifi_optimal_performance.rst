Which Wi-Fi band is recommended for optimal performance?
=========================================================

**Answer**

AmebaPro2 supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi.

However, for the best performance—especially for video streaming or data-intensive applications, we recommend using 5 GHz Wi-Fi, as it provides better throughput and less interference than 2.4 GHz.

If you are connecting via a mobile hotspot, please ensure it is configured to operate on 5 GHz.
