- AmebaD [AMB21 / AMB22 / AMB23 /  AMB25 / AMB26 / BW16 / AW-CU488 Thing Plus] x 1

Example
-------

This example demonstrates how to use the RTC library methods to create a RTC Alarm, so that to do some tasks when an alarm is matched. In particular, the RTC time is set at 16:00:00 and an alarm at 16:00:10. When the time matches, “Alarm Match” 
information will be printed on the serial monitor.

First, select the correct Ameba development board from the Arduino IDE: “Tools” → “Board”.

Then open the "RTCAlarm" example from: “File” → “Examples” → “RTC” → “RTCAlarm”:

| In the example, the RTC time is set at 16:00:00 and an alarm is set at 16:00:10. 
| Upon successfully upload the sample code and press the reset button. 
| When the alarm time (10 seconds) is reached the attached interrupt function will print the following information: “Alarm Matched!” showing in this figure below.
