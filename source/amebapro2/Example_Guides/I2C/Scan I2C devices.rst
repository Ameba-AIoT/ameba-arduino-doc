Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example will scan the I2C bus for devices that is connected to Ameba. When a device is found, it will be shown on the serial monitor
with the address of the device.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

Connect any I2C device to I2C_SDA and I2C_SCL of the board.

Open the example in "File" -> "Examples" -> "AmebaWire" -> "I2C_Scanner".
