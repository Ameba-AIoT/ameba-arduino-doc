Example
-------

This example demonstrates how to use the RTC library methods to create a RTC Alarm, so that to do some tasks when an alarm is matched. In particular, the RTC time is set at 16:00:00 and an alarm at 16:00:10. When the time matches, “Alarm Match” information will be printed on the serial monitor.

First, select the correct Ameba development board from the Arduino IDE: “Tools” -> “Board”.

Then open the ” RTCAlarm ” example from: “File” -> “Examples” -> “RTC” -> “Simple_RTC_Alarm”:

In the example, the RTC time is set at 16:00:00 and an alarm is set at 16:00:10. Upon successfully upload the sample code and press the reset button. When the alarm time (10 seconds) is reached the attached interrupt function will print the following information: “Alarm Matched!” showing in this figure below.
